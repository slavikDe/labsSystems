  - Arrival rate (λ): Tasks arrive every 300±100 time units → mean arrival rate ≈ 1/300 = 0.00333 tasks/time
  - Task size: 500±200
  - Processing speed: 0.5
  - Processing time per task (μ): 500/0.5 = 1000 time units/task → service rate = 1/1000 = 0.001 tasks/time
  - Recycle probability: 5% from D3 back to D1

  Analysis:

  System utilization (ρ) = λ/μ = 0.00333/0.001 = 3.33

  This is critical: ρ > 1 means the system is unstable! Tasks arrive 3.33x faster than they can be processed.

  Expected behavior:
  - Queue grows indefinitely (or until max queue is hit)
  - High failure probability when queue reaches capacity (100)
  - D1 will be saturated (100% utilization)
  - D2 and D3 should also be saturated if tasks can flow through
  - With 5% recycle, effective load on D1 increases further
